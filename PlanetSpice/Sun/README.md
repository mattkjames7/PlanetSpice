# Sun SPICE Tools

This contains a couple of functions which relate to the Sun.

## `HCItoIAU_SUN`

This function converts from HCI (Heliocentric Inertial) coordinates to the IAU_SUN system. The HCI system is such that _z_ is the Sun's rotational axis, _x_ is the solar ascending node on the ecliptic. The IAU_SUN system is such that _z_ points northward along the Sun's rotational axis, while _x_ and _y_ rotate with the Sun.
